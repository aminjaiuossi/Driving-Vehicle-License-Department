This project was developed during Course 19 of the Programming Advices Roadmap.
It is built with .NET Framework and SQL Server (SSMS), focusing on practicing OOP foundations, applying the divide and conquer strategy, and writing clean, readable, scalable, and DRY code.

Overview

The system provides multiple services related to issuing and managing driving licenses, including:
